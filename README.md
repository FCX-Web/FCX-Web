Hi,

Who am I ? ... I'm a junior web developer and freelancer.

FCX Development is the structure that allows me to conduct my freelancing activity in parallel with other professional activities: Logistics, Project Management and Continuous Improvement.

My idea is to allow very small companies to have a visibility on the Web at lower cost. I rely on a production management concept to do this: standardization and differentiation at the latest.

For further informations find me soon on my website.

I will be visible very soon on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.

Bye
